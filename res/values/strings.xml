    <string name="backgroundInfo"><b>There are a number of techniques that can be used to reduce energy consumption.</b>\n\n
    <b>Accelerating lightly. </b>
    Acceleration is the strongest contributor to your vehicles energy consumption.      
    Try to avoid unnecessary acceleration by anticipating traffic.<br /> 
    During city driving, avoid complete stops at traffic ligths by letting the vehicle coast and accelerate smoothly at green lights.\n
    On the motorway maintant a constant speed for optimal efficiency.\n\n
    
	<b>Top speeds. </b>At 110 km/h, driving 20km/h faster consumes 25% for energy.\n\n
	 
    <b>Correct gear. </b>Shift up as soon as possible and avoid high engine speeds.\n\n
    
    <b>Auxiliary devices. </b>Auxiliary devices such as heating significantly increase energy consumption in electric vehicles.\n\n 
    
    <b>Excess weight. </b>The greater the vehicles mass, the higher the energy consumption.
    Avoid carrying unnecessary extra weight.\n\n
    
    <b>Vehicle maintenance. </b>Keep your vehicles in good maintenance and regurlarly check the tire pressure.\n\n
